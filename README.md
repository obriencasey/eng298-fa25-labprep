# Module 7: Pre-Class Lab Prep: Introduction to GitHub and Codespaces

This short Pre-Class Lab Prep introduces you to GitHub and GitHub Codespaces, two essential tools for managing code and running lab environments directly in the cloud - no local setup required. By completing this exercise, you’ll be ready to launch course labs, collaborate on projects, and submit assignments hosted on GitHub

## Learning Objectives
After completing this exercise, you will be able to:

- Explain the purpose of Git and GitHub.
- Create and configure your own GitHub account.
- Fork and clone repositories.
- Launch and use a GitHub Codespace.
- Make, commit, and push basic file changes.
- Submit your work via a public repository link.

## Estimated Time
Approximately 45-60 minutes

### Part 1: Getting Started with GitHub (15–20 minutes)

2. Click **Fork** in the upper-right corner.
3. Confirm your new repository appears under your account.

### Part 3: Launching Your Codespace (15–20 minutes)
1. In your forked repo, click **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main**.
2. Wait for setup, then open the **Terminal** and run:
   ```bash
   pwd
   ls
   ```

### Part 4: Making and Committing Changes (10 minutes)
