# Module 7: Pre-Class Lab Prep: Introduction to GitHub and Codespaces

This short Pre-Class Lab Prep introduces you to GitHub and GitHub Codespaces, two essential tools for managing code and running lab environments directly in the cloud - no local setup required. By completing this exercise, you’ll be ready to launch course labs, collaborate on projects, and submit assignments hosted on GitHub

## Learning Objectives
After completing this exercise, you will be able to:

- Explain the purpose of Git and GitHub.
- Create and configure your own GitHub account.
- Fork and clone repositories.
- Launch and use a GitHub Codespace.
- Make, commit, and push basic file changes.
- Submit your work via a public repository link.

## Estimated Time
Approximately 45-60 minutes (2-3 hours if you complete Intro. To GitHub Training)

### Part 1: Getting Started with GitHub (10–20 minutes if no Intro. to GitHub Training; 2 hours if doing training)
**Intro to GitHub Training**: Before working with repositories, branching, and collaboration, it’s helpful to review GitHub fundamentals. Complete the following Microsoft Learn module to gain hands-on experience with GitHub basics:

👉 [**Introduction to GitHub (Microsoft Learn)**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-github)

This short, self-paced module covers:
- Creating and managing repositories  
- Understanding commits and branches  
- Using pull requests for collaboration  
- Exploring GitHub workflow best practices 
  
1. If you do not have an existing GitHub account, go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) and sign up for a free account.
2. Verify your email address and profile.
3. OPTIONAL: Apply for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

### Part 2: Forking a Repository (10 minutes)
1. Visit the starter repository (e.g., `https://github.com/obriencasey/eng298-fa25-labprep`).
2. Click **Fork** in the upper-right corner.
3. Confirm your new repository appears under your account.

### Part 3: Launching Your Codespace (15-20 minutes)
**Quickstart: GitHub Codespaces**: To get started quickly with cloud-based development environments, check out the official GitHub Codespaces Quickstart guide:

👉 [**Quickstart for GitHub Codespaces**](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/quickstart)

This guide walks you through:
- Creating and configuring a Codespace  
- Connecting to your development environment  
- Running commands, installing tools, and saving changes  
- Managing resources and shutting down your Codespace when finished  

1. In your forked repo from Part 2 above, click **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main**.
2. Wait for setup, then open the **Terminal** and run:
   ```bash
   pwd
   ls
   ```

### Part 4: Making and Committing Changes (10 minutes)
1. Open `hello.md` and add:
   ```
   Hello from [Your Name]! Today is [Date].
   ```
2. Save, commit, and push your change.

## Tips & Troubleshooting
- Verify your GitHub email and Terms of Service.
- Reopen Codespaces under your GitHub profile.
- Stop a Codespace via the bottom-left menu.
